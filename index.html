                        or a fast-paced drop ride, we offer it all. With groups ranging in pace from 14mph 
                        up to a flat out 21-23mph.

                        We have an active group of midweek riders who are well-seasoned cafe experts and

                        to get out on a ride with.

                        multiple groups leaving from Thirskâ€”some go for hilly routes, some for flat ones, 
                        some are social, and some even go out of their way to ride on gravel.
